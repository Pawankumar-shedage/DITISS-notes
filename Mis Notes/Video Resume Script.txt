Hello, my name is Pawankumar Shedage.I'm from Pune,Maharashtra.I have completed my Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule University.

In academics, I secured 84.40% in 10th, 72.00% in 12th, and my engineering percentages are:

FE: 68.90%
SE: 87.50%
TE: 83.70%
BE: 75.50%

My average aggregate is 79% & My Degree % as per my university is 79%.

For my engineering project, I worked on "Suspicious Activity Detection Using Deep Learning." The goal was to make security cameras smarter by detecting unusual activities automatically. We used computer vision and deep learning to recognize suspicious movements and alert security systems faster. This can help prevent crimes by identifying threats early.

My strengths include understanding people and adapting to different situations.

However, my weaknesses are not prioritizing myself when needed and sometimes being lazy. But I am actively working on becoming more proactive and improving my self-discipline.

I enjoy playing basketball and chess, and I am proud to have been an Inter-School Chess Champion.

Coming to my family background, my father is a Senior Clerk at a school, and my mother is a homemaker.

My career objective is to become a Network and Security Engineer. In the next five years, I see myself excelling in this field, contributing to cybersecurity and IT infrastructure.

I pursued C-DAC to deepen my knowledge of Computer Networks and IT Infrastructure Management, which aligns with my long-term career goals.

Thank you for your time!
