Video Resume – Pawankumar Shedage
Introduction
Hello, my name is Pawankumar Shedage, and I am a Computer Engineering graduate from Savitribai Phule University. I have always been passionate about technology, problem-solving, and understanding how things work. Over the years, my curiosity led me to explore different areas of computer science, particularly network security and system infrastructure.

Academic Background
Talking about my academics, I have always been a dedicated student, striving to perform well in my studies.

In 10th grade, I secured 84.40%, which helped me build a strong foundation.
In 12th grade, I scored 72.00%, focusing on science and mathematics, which eventually led me to choose engineering.
During my engineering, my performance was as follows:
First Year (FE): ___%
Second Year (SE): ___%
Third Year (TE): ___%
Final Year (BE): ___%
My average aggregate CGPA stands at ___%.
Engineering Project
In my final year, I worked on a project titled "Suspicious Activity Detection Using Deep Learning."

The main objective was to make security cameras smarter by automatically detecting unusual activities and alerting authorities. Instead of relying on human supervision all the time, our system used computer vision and deep learning to analyze movements and recognize suspicious behavior.

For example, if a person is loitering in a restricted area for too long or if there is any sudden aggressive movement, the system flags it as suspicious. This can be useful in public places, banks, or even private security systems to prevent potential threats.

We built the project using Python and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), training our model with various real-world scenarios. The system was able to detect anomalies with high accuracy and could easily integrate with existing surveillance networks. This experience taught me a lot about machine learning, data processing, and real-world implementation of AI-driven security solutions.

Strengths and Weaknesses
One of my biggest strengths is my ability to understand people and adapt to different situations. Whether it’s working in a team, leading a project, or solving a problem, I try to look at things from different perspectives and find the best possible solution.

However, I do have weaknesses that I am actively working on. Sometimes, I don’t prioritize myself when I should, and I tend to put others first. Also, I can be lazy at times, which affects my efficiency. But I am consciously working on these aspects by improving my time management and developing more self-discipline.

Hobbies and Achievements
Apart from academics, I have always had a keen interest in sports and strategy-based games. I love playing basketball and chess.

Chess, in particular, has helped me develop strategic thinking and patience, which are valuable skills in both life and work. I am proud to say that I was an Inter-School Chess Champion, which was a great achievement for me.

Family Background
Talking about my family, I come from a simple yet supportive background. My father works as a Senior Clerk at a school, and my mother is a homemaker. They have always encouraged me to learn, explore, and follow my passion in technology.

Career Objective
Looking ahead, my career goal is to become a Network and Security Engineer. With increasing cyber threats and digitalization, security has become a critical aspect of every business and organization. I want to specialize in network security, threat analysis, and IT infrastructure, helping companies build safe and secure digital environments.

In the next five years, I see myself working in the cybersecurity domain, gaining expertise in ethical hacking, risk management, and advanced security systems.

Why C-DAC?
To achieve my career goals, I pursued C-DAC to deepen my knowledge of computer networks and IT infrastructure management. This course has given me a strong foundation in networking protocols, security frameworks, and advanced IT technologies, which are essential for a successful career in cybersecurity.

Conclusion
I am excited to step into the professional world, where I can apply my skills and continue to learn. Thank you for your time and consideration! I look forward to contributing to the industry and growing as a Network Security Engineer.
